# Jenkins Deselect All

We will use Developer mode to load the extension.
Here's the steps:


1. Clone this to a folder of your choice. 
1. Open your Chrome Extensions page from 'Tools/Extensions'.
1. Check 'Developer mode' in the top-right corner. 
1. The button `Load unpacked extensionâ€¦` should show up. Click on it.  
1. Point to the folder of the codes, and select the folder. 
1. The icon (currently a 'Cengage' icon) should show up on your toolbar. In the Extensions page, the extension is using a Jenkins icon (probably not a good idea).
